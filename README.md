# Tic Tac Toe

This C++ project implements a classic game of Tic Tac Toe with two game modes:

- **Player vs Player:** Challenge a friend to a strategic battle!
- **Player vs NPC:** Test your skills against a cunning (but not unbeatable) computer opponent.

## Features

- Basic "*AI opponent*" that randomly chooses positions.
- Visual loading animation for the NPC mode (courtesy of ASCII escape sequences).
- Input validation to ensure players choose valid positions.

## Getting Started:

1. Compile the C++ code using a suitable compiler (e.g., g++).
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Choose your game mode (1 for Player vs Player, 2 for Player vs NPC).
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to take turns placing your marks (X or O).
4. The game will automatically detect a win or a tie.

## Notes

1. The current NPC implementation uses a random selection strategy, making it a beatable opponent.
2. You can enhance the project by implementing a more sophisticated AI algorithm for the NPC.
